# todo-management

# Description

This project provides a REST API for managing TODO tasks. It enables users to interact with their tasks by performing operations such as:

- Creating new tasks
- Retrieving specific tasks or all tasks
- Updating existing tasks
- Deleting tasks
- Marking tasks as completed or incomplete

The system implements a role-based access control mechanism to ensure security. There are two primary roles:

- Administrator: Administrators have full permissions, including creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- User: Users can perform most operations but are restricted from certain administrative actions.
